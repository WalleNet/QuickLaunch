## Creating a key binding (Optional, recommended)
1. In the 'Dist' folder, right-click the .exe and create a shortcut
2. Right-click the newly-created shortcut, click 'Properties', and rename it if necessary.
3. You can type a key-binding under 'Shortcut', but it is faster to pin it to your taskbar.
4. Move it to the very left of the taskbar. Now pressing Win+1 will launch the program much faster.
